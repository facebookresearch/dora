## Introduction

Dora is an experiment launching tool which provides the following features:

- Grid search management: automatic scheduling and canceling of the jobs
    to match what is specified in the grid search files. Grid search files
    are pure Python, and can contain arbitrary loops, conditions etc.
- Deduplication: experiments are assigned a signature based on their arguments.
    If you ask twice for the same experiment to be ran, it won't be scheduled twice,
    but merged to the same run. If your code handles checkpointing properly,
    any previous run will be automatically resumed.
- Monitoring: Dora supports basic monitoring from inside the terminal.
    You can customize the metrics to display in the monitoring table,
    and easily track progress, and compare runs in a grid search.

Some Dora concepts:

- A *Grid* is a python file with an `explore function`, wrapped in a `dora.Explorer`.
    The explore function takes a `dora.Launcher` as argument. Call repeatidly
    the `dora.Launcher` with a set of
    hyper-parameters to schedule different experiments.
- An *XP* is a specific experiment. Each experiment is defined by the arguments
    passed to the underlying experimental code, and is assigned a signature
    based on those arguments, for easy deduplication.
- A *signature* is the unique XP identifier, derived from its arguments.
    You can use the signature to uniquely identity the XP across runs, and easily
    access logs, checkpoints etc.
- A *Sheep* is the association of a Slurm/Submitit job, and an XP. Given an XP,
    it is always possible to retrieve the last Slurm job that was associated with it.


## Useful reads

As a Dora user, the following documentation will prove useful to you:

- `dora.explore.Launcher`: a Launcher instance is passed to all explore function
    defined in grid search files.
- `dora.explore.Explorer`: you can subclass the `Explorer` class to customize
    metrics displayed in a grid search file.
- `dora.main.argparse_main`: used to wrap your training script
    when it uses argparse.
- `dora.hydra.hydra_main`: used to wrap your training script
    when it uses hydra.
- `dora.main.get_xp`: get the current `dora.xp.XP`.
